      <h1>My Background</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Saurav Ghosal, and I'm a second year student studying
        computer science at Georgia Tech.
        <strong> GO JACKETS! </strong>
      </p>
      {/* <h1>My Skills</h1> */}
      <p>
        I primarily code in Java. I've taken Object-Oriented Programming in
        Java, and am in the process of taking Data Structures and Algorithms. I
        also know Python, JavaScript (React and Node), and Matlabâ€”and I'm always
        willing to pick up new programming skills!
      </p>
      {/* <h1>My interests</h1> */}
      <p>
        I love to learn new things. I'm very invested in music: I sing and play
        the piano. I enjoy breaking down chord progressions and listening for
        harmonies. One day, I hope to work in a field that bridges my interest
        in music with my passion for computer science.
      </p>
